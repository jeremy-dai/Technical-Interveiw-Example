    "# Question 1\n",
    "Given two strings s and t, determine whether some anagram of t is a substring of s. For example: if s = \"udacity\" and t = \"ad\", then the function returns True. Your function definition should look like: question1(s, t) and return a boolean True or False.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "It is easy test if a string is a substring of another. The question here is how to create all the anagrams for a string. Imagine we have a list of all the anagrams for a certain string t. Every time, we want to create a list of all the anagrams for t plus one addiontal character. The way doing this is add that character to any location of every anagram of t.\n",
